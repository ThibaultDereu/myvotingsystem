This method garantees to elect the Condorcet winner : the candidate that wins a majority of the vote in every head-to-head election against each of the other candidates, that is, a candidate preferred by more voters than any others, whenever there is such a candidate.",
    "PARAGRAPH3": "If there is no Condorcet winner, the Schulze method will elect the best candidate from the top candidates. Several heuristics were invented to achieve this. Here we use the Schwartz method. It is still possible to end up with a tie, if the number of voters is low.",
